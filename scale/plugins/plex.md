# Setup plex
- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6faaMR6aXA)

If there are permissions set for the DataSet, plex cannot access the files.  
There is a discussion [here](https://forums.truenas.com/t/how-to-setting-permissions-by-a-userid-for-a-dataset/27913) 
that should hopefully explain how to set the permission for the dataSet by the userId.
